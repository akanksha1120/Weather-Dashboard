# Weather Dashboard

## Overview
Weather Dashboard is a Spring Boot application that provides weather information using two external APIs: Weatherstack and Weatherbit. It includes two services for fetching current weather data and weather forecasts.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `WeatherService` class in the `com.example.WeatherDashboard` package.
3. Replace the placeholder API keys in the `getWeatherData` and `getWeatherForecast` methods with your actual API keys.
